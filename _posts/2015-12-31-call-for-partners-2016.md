Do you want to help build a conference with a lasting future and big impact? We are happy to announce the launch of the **Open Source Camp 2016**.

The event will bring together important organizations and companies and one of the biggest universities in Romania for a two day event in Ia»ôi.

We want to ensure that every student or developer interested in open source will have the opportunity to participate to this event. Use your networks to reach a large number of people and help promote information about the event nationally.
