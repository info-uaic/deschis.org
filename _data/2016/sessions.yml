  title: "gitfs - Building a Python filesystem"
  description: |
    gitfs is an open-source filesystem which was designed to bring the full powers of Git to everyone, no matter how little they know about versioning.

    A user can mount any repository and all the his changes will be automatically converted into commits. gitfs will also expose the history of the branch you’re currently working on by simulating snapshots of every commit.

  title: "So, you want to be an OpenStack contributor?"
  description: |
    My presentation is addressed to any and all open source enthusiasts who would like to find out more about the second largest open source project out there and find out how they can contribute.

    It will not be a technical presentation, but rather it will cover the history and evolution of the project up until the time of the presentation, talk about the community itself and the governance of the project.

    The strongest focus of my presentation will be in providing you a step-by-step guide on how you can become a contributor. I will guide you through the steps required to become an OpenStack contributor, starting with the basics of signing up and setting up Launchpad, Git and Gerrit, joining the OpenStack Foundation and signing the contributor license agreement.

    We will then talk about the official channels of the community, how you can get in touch with the right people, where to find documentation and useful resources that can help you get started and most importantly help you find something you can work on. If you are not that proficient in Python and DevOps related technologies yet, don’t worry, there are other ways that you can contribute to the project (such as helping out with the documentation, helping triage bugs, translating to other languages and helping build up communities) while you developed the technical skills needed.

    At the end of my presentation you will have what it takes in order to become an active contributor.

  title: "Coriolis: Cloud Migration as a Service"
  description: |
    The purpose of this session is to present the lessons we have learned from our work on Coriolis, a migration as a service project which can effectively move any workload running on Linux or Windows VMs along with the associated storage elements and network topologies to a completely different cloud platform in a fully automated manner. 

    We will outline how Coriolis is designed in accordance with the enterprise-grade standards OpenStack projects are built upon, which allow Coriolis to scale in the face of even the largest migrations. From network device considerations to rebuilding initial ramdisks, we’ll also be enumerating the stumbling blocks we encountered along the way. Attendees can expect to learn numerous aspects related to migrating instances an their scaffolding both cross-hypervisor, and cross-cloud entirely.

  title: "Open Source for Students"
  description: >
    Open Source is more than a fringe topic. Open Source tehnologies and
    communities are now everywhere and part of our day to day lives. Gone
    are the days when Firefox was still in its infancy and Internet Explorer
    dominated the browser market. Open Source has facilitated the advance in
    technology and greatly contributed to the education of
    everyone. However, Open Source is merely a means to an end. And as each
    of us has different goals, each of us may find different benefits of
    using and getting engaged in Open Source.

    In this talk I will share my roughly 10 years experience of working
    close to students and actively promoting Open Source. I will point how
    and why is Open Source useful to students and I will highlight some
    successful stories from students I worked with. I aim to let students
    know of the benefits of being engaged into Open Source for its inherent
    benefits to getting good programming skills, working with others,
    creating products other will use and solving challenging problems.

  title: "Images for the clouds"
  description: >
    From Linux to Windows, every instance spawned in a cloud needs to fulfill
    the same requirements: compatibility with the underlying systems, to be
    lightweight and have a provisioning system.

    We will follow the cloud image's journey through the most used cloud
    platforms and hypervisors, like AWS EC2, Azure, OpenStack, Vmware,
    KVM, Hyper-V.
    The covered images will be Linux-like (Ubuntu, CentOS) and Windows-like
    (8, 10 Client, Server 2012, Nano). No stone will be left unturned, be it
    a driver, minimal resource consumption at boot time, a kickstart or an
    unattend file, provisioning daemon or applying the necessary patches
    offline and online.

    This presentation will help you understand the basic building blocks
    which are required to build an awesome cloud image.

  title: "BSD: the true open-source"
  description: >
    The BSD history is spread over decades, its origins started in 1977
    at University of California. A lot of derivatives explode from the
    original code-base, proprietary and open-source. Nowadays there are
    a bunch of BSD-based operating systems, the main one being FreeBSD.

    In this talk I will share my experience with BSD systems (DragonFly
    to FreeBSD), I will talk about the BSD community, how anyone can get
    involved and also I will name some very known products that are using
    FreeBSD as a base-start (E.g. pfsense).

    Also I will tackle the main differences between Linux-based
    distributions and BSD ones (licensing, design principles). I will also
    outline where FreeBSD excels.

  title: "Introduction to Python"
  description: |
    **About this workshop**

    This workshop will consist of two parts.
    The first part will cover the essentials of the Python programming language. We will start off by getting familiar with Python's data structures, string operations, methods, objects/classes and how to create and run your own modules and packages.

    Then will end up by experimenting with what we can do with it's magic methods, also known as dunder(double underscore) methods, by working on a few examples.

    As the entire workshop will be hands-on, it would be indicated to have with you:

    - A laptop with Python 2.7 installed on your system and set up into your environment path.
    - Any text editor you are comfortable with(Sublime Text, Atom etc.)
    - Willingness to learn and have a good time.

    **Takeaways after the workshop**

    By the end of this workshop you will:

    - know about the basics in Python and it's good and bad parts.
    - know how to write and run your own scripts and packages.
    - be able to call yourself an apprentice Python wizard.

  title: "Functional Programming in Haskell"
  description: |
    The aim of this session is to present a number of functional programming concepts, constructs and practices as they are present within the Haskell programming language. From turning maps and folds into your bread and butter to getting to grips with the more category theory-specific ideas which are used or abused in Haskell, attendees should expect to gain a decent understanding of what purely functional programming has to offer in today’s coding landscape.

  title: "Building images for the clouds"
  description: >
    Based on the presentation "Images for the clouds", this workshop will
    provide a hands-on exeprience on how to build and test a cloud image.

    We will go through the basic tools of handling such a cloud image,
    understanding it and how to modify one.
    The next step is creating one image from scratch, starting from an
    ISO file and a list of requirements, then proofing it on an Openstack
    deployment.

    In this workshop will give you a strong grip on the clouds, unravelling
    how to build an awesome cloud image.
