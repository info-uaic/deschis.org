  bio: |
    I achieved the title of Doctor in Information Sciences (Cum Laude) at "A.I.Cuza" University of Iasi in August 2004 - title of thesis: "_Multimedia Object Manipulation Techniques on Internet_". Also, in 2005 I received "Gheorghe Cartianu" Award of the Romanian Academy for outstanding scientific contributions published in 2003.

    Currently, some of my fields of interest and experience domains are:
    
    - Web Technologies – Web Application Development, Web Interaction, Web Engineering, etc.
    - Web of Data – i.e. Meta-data, Linked Data, (User-based) Knowledge Engineering, Ontologies, (Semantic) Web-based Architectures.
    - Human-Computer Interaction – Social Aspects of Web Applications, Natural Interaction, etc.

    Also, I have background knowledge regarding Distributed Computing – Internet Technologies, Agent-based Computing, Mobility, Cluster, Grid and Cloud Computing, Peer-to-Peer Systems and others.
    My papers are published in the proceedings of different international and national conferences or in special issues of international publications (e.g., IEEE Press, Springer, AAAI Press, IOS Press, Elsevier Science, and others).
    Over the years, I served as a member of the program committees or/and organizing committees of different (inter)national scientific events and summer schools.
    I wrote and edited several books. Since 2002, I am the editor of the Web series of books published by the Polirom Publishing House. Also, I am a co-founder member and supervisor of a young interest group on Web technologies - WebGroup -, founded in March 2000 at the Faculty of Computer Science.

    Răzvan was raised as a geek and an engineer and eventually found himself
    working in academia, with interest in technology, open source and
    organizations of all kinds. He is an unflinching workaholic; when not
    reading or writing e-mails, he enjoys his time teaching, preparing lecture
    and lab materials, coordinating technical and didactic teams, and getting
    involved in student-centered events. More than working, Razvan loves to
    talk, debate and act as a natural-born troll. He works almost
    exclusively in a Linux-based environment; he loves to use the command
    line, Vim, Emacs/Gnus, shell scripting, C programming and a dash of
    Python. He uses his energy in a lot of activities (too many in some
    accounts) and wishes to engage technology in making our life better,
    particulary regarding teaching/education and organizations of all kinds.

    My name is Mihai Carabas and I am a PhD student at University
    POLITEHNICA of Bucharest in the domain of virtualization. I've
    contributed over the last four years in FreeBSD and DragonFlyBSD
    virtualization code.


    I've started working on BSD systems four years ago, on DragonFly BSD,
    tweaking its scheduler to be SMT (or HT) aware. In the next year I've
    implemented hardware nested page table support (EPT for Intel) for the
    DragonFly BSD vkernels eliminating the need of shadow page tables.


    In 2014 I've worked on a bhyve project where I've tried to minimize
    the impact of instruction emulation by caching the emulated
    instructions. Thus, at further usage, we use the hot cache instead of
    fetch-and-decode the faulted instruction again (the work has been
    presented during AsiaBSDCon 2015).


    In 2015 I've started working on porting the bhyve hypervisor on
    ARM-based platforms. I had to write from scratch the low-level context
    switch code and adapt it to a Type-2 hypervisor: ARM, by its design,
    ensures support for Type-1 hypervisors (a hypervisor that runs without
    a host OS). bhyve is written to be part of the FreeBSD and use its
    management features and thus its a Type-2 hypervisor. Another problem
    was to fork the current bhyve code base and reuse it with minor
    modifications for ARM (basically to preserve the same API - in the
    near future to be able to create a generic code-base for bhyve and
    only the context switch code to reside in the machine-dependant code).
    Until now I've manage to run a virtual machine on top of the bhyve
    hypervisor using FastModels simulation platform.


    In 2014 and 2015 in parallel with the work at bhyve I've promoted
    bhyve in my university and coordinated students to do bhyve-related
    projects. One of the succesfull ones is the bhyve-ATA-emulation.

    Community evangelist, in the past three years I’ve build interest
    around Python and OpenStack, by creating and developing local meetup
    groups and national events. I’ve been involved in both open-source
    and Microsoft related communities and user groups, trying to bridge
    the gap between the two. 

    At Cloudbase, I’ve been in charge of developing our relation with
    local user groups and universities, by implementing "summer of code"
    type programs, trainings, workshops and hands-on labs, also meant to
    accelerate the adoption of certain tehnologies (Python, Go, OpenStack
    & Hyper-V) in the academic environment and help integrate students
    into existing communities.
