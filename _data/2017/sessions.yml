  title: "Python mocking - When and How to do it"
  description: >
   We will be taking a look at the DO's and DON'Ts when writting unittests with mocks.
   For the first part of the talk we will be taking a look at how and when mocks should be used,
   since they oftenly tend to be misused or even abused when testing.
   The second part will be focused on real life examples when mocks simply seem to not work and
   have unexpected behaviours and how we can debug or understand these weird behaviours.
   Prior experience with Python mocking is not a must, but it's welcome so that you can follow
   along easier with the examples.
