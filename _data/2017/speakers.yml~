    I achieved the title of Doctor in Information Sciences (Cum Laude) at "A.I.Cuza" University of Iasi in August 2004 - title of thesis: "_Multimedia Object Manipulation Techniques on Internet_". Also, in 2005 I received "Gheorghe Cartianu" Award of the Romanian Academy for outstanding scientific contributions published in 2003.

    Currently, some of my fields of interest and experience domains are:

    - Web Technologies – Web Application Development, Web Interaction, Web Engineering, etc.
    - Web of Data – i.e. Meta-data, Linked Data, (User-based) Knowledge Engineering, Ontologies, (Semantic) Web-based Architectures.
    - Human-Computer Interaction – Social Aspects of Web Applications, Natural Interaction, etc.

    Also, I have background knowledge regarding Distributed Computing – Internet Technologies, Agent-based Computing, Mobility, Cluster, Grid and Cloud Computing, Peer-to-Peer Systems and others.
    My papers are published in the proceedings of different international and national conferences or in special issues of international publications (e.g., IEEE Press, Springer, AAAI Press, IOS Press, Elsevier Science, and others).
    Over the years, I served as a member of the program committees or/and organizing committees of different (inter)national scientific events and summer schools.
    I wrote and edited several books. Since 2002, I am the editor of the Web series of books published by the Polirom Publishing House. Also, I am a co-founder member and supervisor of a young interest group on Web technologies - WebGroup -, founded in March 2000 at the Faculty of Computer Science.

    Răzvan was raised as a geek and an engineer and eventually found himself
    working in academia, with interest in technology, open source and
    organizations of all kinds. He is an unflinching workaholic; when not
    reading or writing e-mails, he enjoys his time teaching, preparing lecture
    and lab materials, coordinating technical and didactic teams, and getting
    involved in student-centered events. More than working, Razvan loves to
    talk, debate and act as a natural-born troll. He works almost
    exclusively in a Linux-based environment; he loves to use the command
    line, Vim, Emacs/Gnus, shell scripting, C programming and a dash of
    Python. He uses his energy in a lot of activities (too many in some
    accounts) and wishes to engage technology in making our life better,
    particulary regarding teaching/education and organizations of all kinds.

    I'm by definition what most would call a technology enthusiast.
    I'm a restless learner, this being by far the most essential
    trait that drove my passion for programming ever since the
    very start.

    I devoted myself to constant learning for the past few years,
    the main achievement out of this journey being that now I am
    a part of the growing and awesome Cloudbase family.

    An outgoing IT enthusiast is what will describe Matei
    the best. He is a strong believer in open source software 
    and a Python addict, he feels like home on a Linux based 
    environment and would never trade vim for anything.
    When he is not geeking about technology or attending 
    University you will find him enjoying some video games.
