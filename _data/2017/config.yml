    Finally, the step we've been waiting for has been taken by a large
    amount of tech industry giants and important figures. From the beginning
    of the IT industry, the Open Source trend has been an element of geek legends,
    but the myth becomes reality in a push of the industry towards greater grounds.
    In our enthusiasm, we want to share the beautiful things this old taboo subject has
    to offer in the software industry, with the help, of course, of great minds with
    state of the art skills. So we hope you'll give us the chance to impress in our
    Open Source Camp hosted in Ipotești, Botoșani this year. Join us for tech talks, 
    workshops and an awesome hackathon that will keep you up in excitement with a
    variety of specially crafted challenges and prizes.
